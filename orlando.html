          <h1>Orlando, FL</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Orlando</b> is a city in, and the county seat of, Orange County,
            Florida, United States. Part of Central Florida, it is the center of
            the Orlando metropolitan area, which had a population of 2,509,831
            in 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is the
            sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States and
            the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida behind Miami and
            Tampa Bay. Orlando had a city population of 307,573 in the 2020
            census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Florida behind
            Jacksonville, Miami, and Tampa. It is the state's most populous
            inland city. <br />
            <br />

            Orlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due
            to tourism, major events, and convention traffic. It is the
            third-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City and Miami,
            with over 2.9 million visitors as of 2022. Orlando International
            Airport is the 13th-busiest airport in the United States and the
            29th-busiest in the world. The two largest and most
            internationally renowned tourist attractions in the Orlando area are
            the Walt Disney World Resort, opened by the Walt Disney Company in
            1971 and located about 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown
            Orlando in Bay Lake, and the Universal Orlando Resort, opened in
            1990 as a major expansion of Universal Studios Florida and the only
            theme park inside Orlando city limits. <br />
            <br />

            With the exception of the theme parks, most major cultural sites
            like the Orlando Museum of Art and Dr. Phillips Center for the
            Performing Arts and world-renowned nightlife, bars and clubs are
            located in Downtown Orlando. Other attractions like The Wheel at
            ICON Park are located along International Drive. The city is also
            one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions;
            Orange County Convention Center is the second-largest convention
            facility in the United States. <br />
            <br />

            Like other major cities in the Sun Belt, Orlando grew rapidly from
            the 1960s into the first decade of the 21st century. Orlando is home
            to the University of Central Florida, which became the largest
            university campus in the United States in terms of enrollment as of
            2015.[needs update] In 2010, Orlando was listed as a "Gamma+" level
            global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.
