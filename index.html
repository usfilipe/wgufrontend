          <h1>Florida</h1>
          <br>

          <p>
            <b>Florida</b> is a state in the Southeastern region of the United
            States. It borders the Gulf of Mexico to the west, Alabama to the
            northwest, Georgia to the north, the Bahamas and Atlantic Ocean to
            the east; and the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the south. It is
            the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
            Ocean. With a population of over 21 million, it is the third-most
            populous state in the United States, the most populous among the
            easterly states, and ranks eighth in population density as of 2020.
            It spans 65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), ranking 22nd in area
            among the 50 states. The Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the
            cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, is the
            state's largest metropolitan area with a population of 6.138
            million, and the state's most-populous city is Jacksonville with a
            population of 949,611. Florida's other major population centers
            include Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of
            <b>Tallahassee</b>. <br />
            <br />

            Various American Indian tribes have inhabited Florida for at least
            14,000 years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León became
            the first known European to make landfall, calling the region La
            Florida for its lush greenery and the Easter season (Pascua Florida in Spanish). Florida subsequently
            became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently
            settled by Europeans, with the settlement of St. Augustine, founded
            in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. Florida was a
            Spanish territory frequently attacked and coveted by Great Britain
            before Spain ceded it to the U.S. in 1819 in exchange for resolving
            the border dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas. Florida
            was admitted as the 27th state on March 3, 1845, and was the
            principal location of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the longest and
            most extensive of the Indian Wars in U.S. history. The state seceded
            from the Union on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven
            original Confederate States, and was readmitted to the Union after
            the Civil War on June 25, 1868. <br />
