          <h1>Miami, FL</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Miami</b>, officially the City of Miami, is a coastal metropolis
            in the U.S. state of Florida and the seat of Miami-Dade County in
            South Florida. It is the core of the much larger Miami metropolitan
            area, which, with a population of 6.14 million, is the
            second-largest metropolitan area in the Southeast after Atlanta, and
            the ninth-largest in the United States.With a population of
            442,241 within its city limits as of the 2020 census, Miami is
            the second-most populous city proper in Florida after Jacksonville.
            Miami has the third-largest skyline in the U.S. with over 300
            high-rises, 58 of which exceed 491 ft (150 m).<br />
            <br />

            Miami is a major center and leader in finance, commerce, culture,
            arts, and international trade.Miami's metropolitan area is
            by far the largest urban economy in Florida, with a gross domestic
            product of $344.9 billion as of 2017. According to a 2018 UBS
            study of 77 world cities, Miami is the third-richest city in the
            U.S. and the third-richest globally in purchasing power. Miami
            is a majority-minority city with a Hispanic and Latino population of
            310,472, or 70.2 percent of the city's population, as of 2020. <br />
            <br />

            Downtown Miami has among the largest concentrations of international
            banks in the U.S. and is home to several large national and
            international companies. The Health District is home to several
            major University of Miami-affiliated hospital and health facilities,
            including Jackson Memorial Hospital, the nation's largest hospital
            with 1,547 beds, and the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine,
            the University of Miami's academic medical center and teaching
            hospital, and others engaged in health-related care and research.
            PortMiami, the city's seaport, is the busiest cruise port in the
            world in both passenger traffic and cruise lines. The Miami
            metropolitan area is the second-most visited city or metropolitan
            statistical area in the U.S. after New York City, with over 4
            million visitors as of 2022. Miami has sometimes been called the
            "Gateway to Latin America" because of the magnitude of its
            commercial and cultural ties to the region. In 2022, Miami
            ranked seventh in the U.S. in business activity, human capital,
            information exchange, cultural experience, and political engagement.
